          Wherever you look, data is getting collected in one way or another. So
          also the need to actually find insights in large data sets and making
          them easily understandable with visualizations is constantly on the
          rise. Simultaneously the data vis industry is growing. But how is this
          industry different for freelancers compared to employees? What is
          similar regardless of whether you work in a permanent position or
          self-employed?

          Other role combinations (like respondents who selected that they are
          hobbyists, students or academics) make up a smaller proportion when
          viewed individually.

        <TextSection>
          When working in the data vis industry, respondents target specific
          audiences with their viz. These target audiences vary also quite a

          Freelancers also target these groups, but they do it way less, since
          they mainly produce a viz{" "}

            for the general public, executives, researches or policy makers

          Creating an intriguing data viz is important, but nothing without the

          The top three communication channels are similar for both employees

            in the form of presentations, in dashboards or in documents/reports.

          <br />
          But stronger differences follow:{" "}

            freelancers rely on webpages, social media, scrollytelling or
            physical results
          </Hl>{" "}
          (like a print or installation) more often than employees.{" "}
