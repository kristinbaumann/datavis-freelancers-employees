## Description

Wherever you look, data is getting collected in one way or another. So also the need to actually find insights in large data sets and making them easily understandable with visualizations is constantly on the rise. Simultaneously the data vis industry is growing. But how is this industry different for freelancers compared to employees? What is similar regardless of whether you work in a permanent position or self-employed?

## Process

idea to only look at freelancers
previously worked in data vis as an employee as well as a freelancer
also during past years quite a few people I know made the switch to self-employment

data analysis with nodejs to look if there are interesting insights
too few data points too only look within freelance role combinations

switch to compare employees and freelance

data analysis with nodeJS and in Google Sheets

selected in my opinion interesting aspects

started with euler diagram for roles, but switch to pictogram chart(?)
started with multiple bar chart for other questions but hard to compare

came across connected dot plot

data sorting

Flourish

coding of static website with Gatsby, embedded Flourish
