          Wherever you look, data is getting collected in one way or another.
          Therefore the need to find insights in large data sets and make them
          easily understandable using visualizations is constantly on the rise.
          More people are joining the data visualization industry and have to
          decide how they want to work in it. So what are the differences
          between freelancers and employees?

          The chart below shows the distribution of the respondentsâ€™ roles
          grouped to differentiate between employees, freelancers, and others.
          They described their roles by selecting up to seven options in this
          multiple choice question, resulting in many different role
          combinations.
          <br />
          The <Hl t="em">majority of the respondents are solely employees</Hl>.
          People who work exclusively as{" "}
          <Hl t="fr">freelancers make up only about a fifth</Hl> of the number
          of employees. But there is also a considerable number of people who
          work simultaneously in a permanent position as well as self-employed.
          <br />
          Other role combinations (like respondents who selected that they are
          hobbyists, students, or academics) make up smaller proportions when
          viewed individually.

          Looking only at the strongest differences between employees and
          freelancers, two stereotypes emerge:
          <br />
          On one hand, there is the freelancer who is more focused on the
          creative side, a designer using Illustrator to create visualizations
          for a scrollytelling website or social media to target the general
          public or specific decision-makers.
          <br />
          On the other hand, there is the employee, an analyst or manager who is
          creating data visualizations with Excel, Tableau, or PowerPoint and
          delivers them to executives via presentations, dashboards, or even
          Email.
          <br />
          <br />
          Of course, the reality is way more diverse than these stereotypes are.
          The perfect working environment one can thrive in means something
          different for everybody. I hope this analysis helps you in your
          decision process on whether to go freelance or work in a permanent
          position - or even do both simultaneously ðŸ¤ž
